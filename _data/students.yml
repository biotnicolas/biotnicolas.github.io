  description: >
    Xiaoran is a PhD student at the Forschungszentrum Jülich. His previous experiences are based on studying his major, Viticulture and Enology, with modeling and web applications. His interest is to develop a mechanistic plant model (CPLantBox)that traces carbon and water movement in maize by explicit coupling of xylem and phloem fluxes.
