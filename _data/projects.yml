  name: Root System Markup Language
  description: >
    Together with researchers from INRIA, CPIB, Juelich, Vienna and Louvain, we created the Root System Markup Language (RSML) that has been designed to alleviate two major bottlenecks: (i) to enable portability of root architecture data between different software tools in an easy and interoperable manner allowing seamless collaborative work, and (ii) to provide a standard format upon which to base central repositories which will soon arise following the expanding worldwide root phenotyping effort.

  name: SmartRoot
  description: >
    SmartRoot is a semi-automated image analysis software which streamlines the quantification of root growth and architecture for complex root systems. 
    The software combines a vectorial representation of root objects with a powerful tracing algorithm which accommodates to a wide range of image source and quality. 
    The software supports a sampling-based analysis of root system images, in which detailed information is collected on a limited number of roots selected by the user according to specific research requirements.

  description: >
    The Plant Image Analysis website is an online, manually curated, database referencing more than 130 plant image analysis software solutions. 
    The website presents each software in a uniform and concise manner enabling users to identify the available solutions for their experimental needs. 
    The website also enables user feedback, evaluations and new software submissions. The aim of such a toolbox is to help users to find solutions, and to provide developers a way to exchange and communicate about their work.

  name: PRIMAL
  description: >
    PRIMAL stands for a Pipeline of Root Image analysis using MAchine Learning. In short, the pipeline use Machine Learning techniques (Random Forest), to streamline the image analysis of large root dataset. PRIMAL needs only a subset of the data to be analysed manually, instead of the full dataset. That subset is then used to train the algorithm behind PRIMAL the predict the parameters of interest, based on automatically acquired descriptors.

  description: >
    The focus of CRootBox is the simulation of different types of root architecture, and to provide a generic interface for coupling with arbitrary soil/environmental models, e.g., in order to determine the impact of specific root architectures on function.

  name: archiDART
  description: >
    archiDART is an R package that was developed for the automated analysis of plant root system architectures from Root System Markup Language (RSML) files. The package enable the extraction of morphological (length, diameters), dynamic (growth rates, tropisms) and topological (Fitter indices, persistent homology) traits.

  name: Flowering Interactive Database - FLOR-ID
  description: >
    The transition to flowering is an essential step of the plant life cycle that is tightly controlled by both endogenous and environmental cues. Its regulation is extremely complex and involves hundreds of genes that are part of highly interconnected pathways. We are currently building a new web-based interactive resource organized around a curated database of the flowering time genes, FLOR-ID. This project is a collaboration with [Fred Bouch√©](http://www.fredericbouche.com/). Article about the database [here (in french)](http://le15ejour.ulg.ac.be/jcms/c_49741/fr/genetique-de-la-floraison) and [here (Flowering Highlights)](http://floweringhighlights.org/2016/01/21/flowering-highlights-a-database-for-all-things-flowering-by-frank-wellmer/).
