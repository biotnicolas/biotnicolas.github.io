    Since 2008, I have performed reviews for the dozen of journals. However, since 2021, I decided to decline reviewing duties for for-profit journal and editors and focus my free work on non-profit and/or community journals. These are the ones listed below. 


    Plant Physiology, New Phytologist, GigaScience, PLoS One, Journal of Experimental Botany, Annals of Botany, Plant Direct, in silico Plants
