  V1 We believe that “science” is one way of learning about the world, alongside art, imagination, intuition, faith, vibes, etc. We know there is value in pretending that the world can be simplified to single disciplines, but we know these constructs are not truths. We believe that curiosity driven research can lead to actionable science, if it is used to generate questions, not give answers. We believe that algorithms cannot be trusted to make decisions on behalf of people.
